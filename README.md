# Mentoring Portal

## Overview

I had recently visited a school in collaboration with an NGO for a mentorship session for the underpriveleged students.

Recognizing the strong desire among students for continued interaction and mentorship following initial sessions, I collaborated with [Manav Kushwaha](https://github.com/manav-2004) to develop a dedicated online mentorship portal. This platform aims to provide a safe and accessible environment for ongoing support, guidance, and resource sharing.

## Purpose

The Mentoring Portal is designed to:

- Offer a secure platform for sustained engagement between students and mentors.
- Provide a repository of valuable resources for career exploration, exam preparation, and skill development.
- Facilitate a community where students can seek guidance and mentors can offer advice.
